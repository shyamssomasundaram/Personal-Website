   <p>Bioinformatics Scientist - Data Modeler Intern at The National Marrow Donor Program (May 2014 &#8208 Present)</p>
   <center><a href="https://bethematch.org" target="_blank"><img src="NMDPImage.png"></a></center>
   <p>The National Marrow Donor Program is a non-profit organization which manages and maintains the Be The Match registry,
      the largest and most diverse registry for bone marrow transplantation in the world. It has been accredited for performing transplantations to cure 
      blood related cancers like Leukemia and Lymphoma for the past 25 years.
   </p>
   <p>As a Data Modeler Intern, I am responsible for assisting in developing successful data modeling technical 
   solutions for the Bioinformatics Research Department of the NMDP. This includes responsibilities (with supervision) 
   of collecting, analyzing, reviewing, documenting, and communicating business needs between NMDP Bioinformatics Research 
   staff and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) IT. This also includes responsibility 
   of providing enterprise applications development and database modeling changes to existing applications as specified.

   <p>Some of the my accomplishments include:</p>                           
   <ul>
         <li>Strengthened the understanding of healthcare related metadata/data for data analysts by 
         creating UML diagrams using Sparx Enterprise Architect that serve as a visual representation.</li>
         <li>Designed a Physical Data Model (PDM) using PowerDesigner for the healthcare domain that facilitates
          the exchange of bone marrow transplant related data between transplant centers.</li>
         <li>Developed a data dictionary using a Python script describing the elements of the HML data standard 
          that guides clinicians, biostatisticians and data analysts, and enhances its utilization.</li>
         <li>Organized the Agile Sprint tracking process by generating a scoring mechanism in Python that 
         allows members to track progress using a point system.</li>
         <li>Evaluated open-source NoSQL data storage options that provide a cost-effective solution, 
         well suited for a non-profit organization.</li>
   </ul>
